# Cubersecurity-Threat-Analysis
 "An end-to-end data analysis project on cybersecurity threats using a full data pipeline: Excel for cleaning, PostgreSQL for analysis, and Power BI for visualization."
### Overview
This project focuses on a data-driven analysis of suspicious web traffic to identify potential security threats. Using a robust data pipeline, I performed data cleaning in **Excel**, executed in-depth analysis in **PostgreSQL**, and created a professional dashboard in **Power BI** to visualize key attack patterns.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Excel:** Used for initial data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing.
- **PostgreSQL:** Served as the database for storing and executing complex analytical queries.
- **Power BI:** Utilized for building an interactive, professional dashboard with key visualizations.

  ### Methodology
1.  **Data Preparation:** Data was cleaned in Excel to handle inconsistencies and ensure data types were correct.
2.  **Data Modeling:** The cleaned data was loaded into a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying.
3.  **Analysis:** SQL queries were written to extract key insights about traffic, ports, and countries.
4.  **Visualization:** A comprehensive dashboard was built in Power BI to present the findings.

### Final Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides a complete visual summary of the project.

### Key Insights
- **Geographical Threats:** The majority of suspicious activity was traced to specific countries, which were highlighted on a map.
- **Vulnerable Ports:** My analysis identified which destination ports were most frequently targeted by threats.
- **Data Volume Anomalies:** I uncovered patterns where high volumes of incoming data were not matched by outgoing data, indicating potential infiltration attempts.
### How to View this Project
- **View SQL Queries:** You can review all the analytical queries I wrote in the `analysis_queries.sql` file.
- **View Dashboard:** The interactive dashboard can be viewed on Power BI Service. [Link to your published Power BI dashboard]
